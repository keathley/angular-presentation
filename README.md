# Presentation on Angular JS

This is from a 15 minute presentation I gave about angular that 
shows the basics of bindings, controllers, and filters.

## Install

Just git everything:

    $ git clone https://github.com/spyc3r/angular-presentation.git

And install

    $ bundle install
    $ rails s

You should be good to go.
